# Two Pointers

This directory contains solutions to problems using the Two Pointers technique.

**Concept:**

The Two Pointers technique involves using two pointers (usually indices) to traverse a data structure (typically an array or string) in a coordinated way.  There are several common patterns:

*   **Opposite Directions:** Pointers start at opposite ends and move towards each other.  Useful for palindrome checks, reversing arrays, etc.
*   **Same Direction:** Pointers start at the same position and move at different speeds (e.g., "fast" and "slow" pointers).  Useful for finding cycles in linked lists, or for problems where you need to compare elements at different positions.
*   **From Start:** Both the pointers start at the beginning, commonly used in sliding window problems.
